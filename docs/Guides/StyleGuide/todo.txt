This is a todo list for whoever continues the documentation:
Pruning:
In this document, 'pruning' refers to removing irrelevant content that is either obvious or does not apply to OpenCircuits either because these concepts are not in use of because a new local standard has been established
The pruning methodology thus dar has been to check each statement according to the following criteria:
    Is it common sense?
    Is it deprecated (some outdated content is present)?
    Is it relevant to the codebase?
    Is it esoteric?
    Has another, different standard been established within the codebase?
    Does it add value (is it significant)?
Depending on the above answesr, choose whether or not to keep it. If unsure, ask Leon


Generally:
Pull Requests.md can be expanded upon but can be seen as complete as it stands
React.md is in the process of being pruned
Redux.md is in the writing/formatting process: content is being added before being pruned
SCSS.md is in the process of being pruned
Typescript.md is in the process of being pruned

File Specific:
Typescript.md: 
    'Events' section is currently blanked and needs to include a style guide for Open Circuits-style event handling
Redux.md:
    Restyle to be in same style as other guides
    Fix table of contents structure
    include actual content in table of contents
    trim material
    add bold and italics and code sections
    remove style guide url from above

Markdown tips, if you're having issues:
Having consecutive hmtl < a > tags within a line will break the markdown (e.g.<a name="types--primitives"></a><a name="1.1"></a> ) and nothing will render. Another potential reason for non-rendering is whitespace on empty line (VSCode sometimes indents empty lines and this indentation breaks the MD making things not render)
